# 🕵️‍♂️ Fraud Detection Analysis

This repository contains a complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning workflow for detecting fraudulent transactions using the **AIML Dataset.csv** file.

The entire project is implemented inside the Jupyter Notebook:  
**`Fraud_Detection_Analysis.ipynb`**

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze a transaction dataset and build a machine learning model that can classify transactions as **fraudulent** or **non-fraudulent**.

Key steps included:
- Data loading & inspection  
- Exploratory Data Analysis  
- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- One-hot encoding of categorical features  
- Train–test split  
- Logistic Regression model (via a sklearn pipeline)  
- Model performance evaluation

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

The analysis uses the following libraries:

- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-Learn**
  - ColumnTransformer  
  - OneHotEncoder  
  - Train/Test Split  
  - LogisticRegression  
  - Pipeline  
  - Accuracy, Classification Report
